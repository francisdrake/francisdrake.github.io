      <h2>reading 06: the rat race</h2>

      <p>
        Everything that Paul Graham said about success in this world is stuff I’ve heard before. Yes, joining a startup and escaping the corporate world can lead to a great payout in the end. Yes, you can make that $3 million in a few years. But chances of that are slim, and to ensure that you’re one of the ones that makes it, you have to be coachable and persistent but not stubborn, and be willing to work absolutely as hard as you can. A daunting but simultaneously enticing task.
      </p>

      <p>
        I interned in the summer of ‘24 at a late-stage startup called Gnosis Freight. It basically provided enhanced visibility and predictive analytics for container lifecycle management. The logistics industry is very behind the curve in terms of technology, and many companies email excel spreadsheets back and forth, and half the time have no idea if their containers are in Shanghai or Long Beach. It was such an obvious idea in hindsight. And the cofounders that started the startup were a bunch of sneaky genius frat dudes at Auburn who understood both sides of the coin - the computer science piece and the supply chain piece. The company has done very well, and I attribute that a lot to its vibrant culture and people who lived and breathed their mission. Our CRO told me I was “too normal to be a software engineer,” and I did not know what to make of it. All that to say, startups are cool, the atmosphere is fun, but to be the initial ten people at the company, to be the one with the idea, that takes a different level of drive. And so, when asked what’s the next big thing? If I knew it, I’d be doing it already and hopefully have the drive and the means to make it happen.
      </p>

        So in the meantime, I’m doing just what Paul Graham was talking about. I entirely resonate with what Graham says, that I’m “suffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: [I] don't know what makes [me] happy, what the various kinds of work are really like, or how well [I] could do them.” Exactly. He says, “The less sure you are about what to do, the more important it is to choose options that give you more options in the future.” That’s why I am going into consulting. I want to get exposure to a lot of different things, with the hopes of finding one thing that clicks and which I’ll end up pursuing down the road. And if all else fails, maybe I’ll be that one guy on LinkedIn who worked at Microsoft for 20 years then became a goose farmer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Should society and culture encourage risk taking and starting businesses? From an economic perspective, certainly. It’s what will help us grow and innovate the fastest. But I want to mention an assumption that Graham has inherently made in all of his essays. He assumes that success is entirely determined by output to society - by making something that people deem valuable and enjoying money as a consequence. He seems to get a little lost in the rat race of it all. I think success is achievable in many different ways, and does not just come from work. I think it is all about one’s circumstances and intention. If you work day in and day out as a McDonalds employee to provide for your family, and you work diligently to please your customers and do your job to the best of your ability, that is just as noble to me as creating some startup that alters the future of an industry. It is the intention of your work, not the output, and so while it’s great to create a startup, make millions of dollars, and donate it all to charity, that’s not the only path to success.
