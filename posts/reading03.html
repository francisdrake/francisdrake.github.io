        Quite similar to what unfolds in part three of <em>Hackers - Heroes of the Revolution</em>, <em>The Studio</em> is a satirical show about the Hollywood filmmaking industry. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, Matt Remick arrives at his boss’ office to be promoted to be the new head of Continental Studios and could not be more excited to be an executive doing what he loves: making movies. As the show unfolds, however, he faces the reality of the industry: all anyone cares about is making commercially successful movies, epitomized in the concentration of effort towards producing a trivial Kool-Aid movie. Attention to detail and complex screenwriting are not the movies that make money. Such a situation is parallel to Ken Williams’ emphasis on pumping out games regardless of their quality and “trying to maximize sales by duplicating even moderate successes [where] games looked worse than the originals.” It seems tragic, then, to enter an industry one initially loves like Matt Remick and John Harris, only to be jaded by what it has become.

        This phenomenon extends beyond filmmaking and video game development. It permeates popular culture and mass media, where trends are paraded as spectacles and monetized. It reminds me of a class I took abroad called Reading Popular Music. We thought a lot about what makes music popular and mainstream, which was often contrasted with music we deemed to be authentic. The truest, most authentic folk singers in America like Huddie Ledbetter were ultimately captured (much like the movie <em>Trolls Band Together…</em>) and their sounds were repackaged in such a way that their authenticity appears contrived. Is it a form of reclaiming, then, when true artists make art just to appeal to the masses if they are cognizant and doing it to prove a point? Likewise, if hackers conform in a way to society and make mindless games for a giant conglomerate, do they not have some power in that?

        I think the Hacker Ethic can survive in a world of commercial and proprietary software, not as a blazing fire but a persistent spark. In spite of corporate giants taking over and success being measured by profit, I believe the hackers’ love and devotion towards their craft will live on, even if their games are not the ones making the most money or are the most known. There is a fundamental appreciation of video games, much like there is for music and movies and all other artforms, which will ensure their very existence. My hope comes from reading <em>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow</em> by Gabrielle Zevin, which tells the story of video game creators Sam and Sadie. Sam’s love for video games began when he was in a life-altering accident where his mom was killed; it was playing <em>Oregon Trail</em> in the hospital’s waiting room that helped him get through it and helped him have some autonomy in the virtual world. Sadie met Sam in that same waiting room while her sister was undergoing cancer treatment. Much later, they went on to craft a game called <em>Ichigo</em>, which captures everything I imagine the joy of gaming to include: a character who Sam personally identifies with, a game engine built entirely by Sadie, and graphics with such extreme attention to detail, with extra care taken to ensure that the water appears a certain way. Though Sadie gets burnt out at certain points, other attempts at making games fail, and life events trump the importance of video games, this fundamental intention and care that Sadie and Sam put into their games speaks for itself.

        I think neither a "professional programmer, ... the goal-oriented ... responsible engineer" nor a hacker with the "love for [computing] in [your] heart" and "hacker perfectionism in [your] soul" is better. These two types of people will likely be coworkers in today’s society, and both will be able to meaningfully contribute to a game or project. The responsible engineer will steadily drive progress, whereas the hacker will drive innovation and take risks. The early hacker-dominant culture at On-Line was not sustainable: it lacked “predictability, order, control, careful planning, uniform outlook, decorum, adherence to guidelines, and a structured hierarchy”; it needed the responsible engineer. But then there were things “that only a person in love with gaming could implement,” those that “no one but a true hacker would approach with the lunatic intensity and finicky artistic exactitude of John Harris.” Too much of either and it won’t work.
