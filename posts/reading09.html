      <h2>reading 09: just for fun</h2>

      <p>I find the story of Linus Torvalds’ upbringing and creation of Linux inspiring. A couple of things struck me right off the bat. First, his talk of himself is pretty self-deprecating. For a guy who created one of the most famous operating systems in the world, it’s shocking that his self esteem seems so low on the page. Yes, he admitted that his code was “always, um, perfect,” but he did not think he was attractive or socially adept. I guess it’s comforting to know that we all suffer from insecurities, even those who have accomplished so much.</p>

      <p>Second, it was fascinating to hear about Finnish culture. I really think Linus is a product of his environment, his nonchalance towards his success and disinterest in money ingrained in him from the start. Finland is known to be a happy country with a degree of socialism, and I think the incentives to achieve great financial success and fame were not there. Linus was just doing what he found interesting, what he was passionate about. It did not seem as if he was surrounded by people caught in the rat race. He wasn’t a part of the competitive gangs at MIT and Berkeley. He had one friend in computer science who spoke Swedish. He knew nothing of the pressure cookers Gates, Jobs, and Zuckerberg were all caught up in. He lived in a sort of blissful ignorance.</p>

      <p>I do not think I will accomplish anything close to what Linus did. First off, I am already too brainwashed by the notion of success that has plagued prestigious universities across the country. Second, I don’t have the passion, which I’ve talked about before. I wish I had a “thing.” Linus was known as the math guy, the computer guy. My dad talks about how much he loves trading, how since he was a kid he was betting on horse races, downloading the Wall Street Journal. He said work did not feel at all like work. I don’t have that thing.</p>

      <p>That being said, I’ve always had the creative itch. Every morning before school as a kid, my mom would put out paper and pencils and I would produce a drawing, usually of a fantasy world or interior of a house. Something that involved an intricate layout. I played Minecraft a TON just so I could create a particular world that I could exist in. Fast forward to now, I love curating photos that go together in my mind, Spotify playlists that encapsulate a particular feeling, itineraries for travel that involve a specific architectural vibe and 4pm afternoon coffee. I don’t know what this translates into for a career, and I haven’t had the time to try any projects that might help me better articulate my interests.</p>

      <p>If I had all the time in the world to undertake a project of my choosing, I’d probably want to produce my own magazine, with all my own writing, photographs, and design. Entirely by me. Maybe it’d be a lifestyle magazine but with undertones of literature, music, and architecture. But that’s not a career, I tell myself. That’s not intellectually stimulating enough. It’s not impressive to people. And, plus, the economy is rough. How is that sustainable?</p>

      <p>I try to tell myself that my career is not my life. I can work a job and enjoy things outside of it. But I long for the two to be closely aligned, and envy those who have that. So my story is not going to be much like Linus’ or any crazy successful tech giant. I think I want my story to be more about my relationship with others, myself, and God. I’ve learned I don’t need to be great at anything. I want to be good. Good at school and at my job only in the sense that I do what is expected of me. A good friend. Good at finding things I enjoy. Good at staying true to myself.</p>
