      <h2>reading 01: for the love of the game</h2>
      <p>Being a true hacker is more than just being proficient in coding. It is an entire culture with its roots at MIT in the 50s and 60s. It is a mode of existence that prioritizes curiosity in computer programming over everything else, and often is just about the pleasure taken in the endeavor rather than fulfilling a particular goal or need. It is a system based on meritocracy that does not care about one’s background or oddities, which is embodied in the hackers’ acceptance of Peter Deutsch: “by virtue of his computer knowledge he was worthy of equal treatment.” True hackers are skeptical of bureaucracy and believe all information should be free to access, and seem to lean towards libertarianism or anarchism, that is, if they are political at all.</p>

      <p>The aesthetic of the true hacker that Levy describes is fascinating and very similar to what I pictured: “bright young men of disheveled appearance,” working late at night with little sleep, ordering takeout to eat while they work, and possessing overall poor hygiene due to the fact that “they are oblivious to their bodies and to the world in which they move.” Beyond physical appearance, what struck me also was Levy’s understanding of their social nature. David Silver noted how the focus was not on having “warm conversations” with one another, but instead “on sheer brainpower.” As a result, hackers are often perceived as loners or socially awkward, but I actually think that there is a deeper connection and mutual respect present in this joint goal that makes up for their perceived social isolation.</p>

      <p>I think that it would be really cool to be a true hacker, but that I do not fit the mold. Being a true hacker is intimidating. My cousin (<a href="https://colindrake.me/">https://colindrake.me/</a>) meets the criteria; I remember being in awe hearing about him producing electronic music via code and getting a grant from Google to do research in school. In the notion that “you could be fourteen years old and dyslexic, and be a winner” or “you could be bright, sensitive, and willing to learn, and still be considered a loser,” I feel that I am more like the loser in this case. I do not necessarily think it is a bad thing, but more so that it means that I have a generalized intelligence rather than a specialized one - I am not a genius in one particular area like true hackers are. What’s more is I feel that this romanticized period of hacking in the 50s and 60s did not make room for women; though Margaret Hamilton was very successful, she nevertheless was separate from the male hackers who “[played] around on the ninth floor.”</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, the hacker ethos appeals to me, especially in the context of growing reliance upon artificial intelligence. This unparalleled intellectual curiosity, this devotion to their craft, this desire to figure out what “The Right Thing is” is very admirable. The thrill of being able to synthesize “all the thousands of bits of information” as if “your own mind had merged into the environment of the computer” is something I strive for though hardly ever attain. I feel that modern computer science college students must be reminded of the curiosity and drive of their forebearers and motivated by the pursuit of these great eureka moments so as to discourage the use of AI to complete assignments. Moreover, the quest of the true hackers hits on my deeper philosophical beliefs – that there is a deeper truth out there, and that we get closer to it on earth through noble intellectual pursuits like computer programming. Ultimately, I do not aspire to become a true hacker, as the lifestyle and mindset do not fully align with my own personality. Nevertheless, I understand hackers’ aesthetic and ethos and hold great respect for their invaluable contributions to modern software development and artificial intelligence.</p>
