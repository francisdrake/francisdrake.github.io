      <p>
        ESR mentions many reasons as to why people contribute to open source. Some do out of benevolence, others self interest. One particular attitude that struck me was the one ESR called that of the pragmatist. The one who is indifferent to commercial software “as long as [they] get the source or it does what [they] want it to do.” The only issue the pragmatist has with the corporate world is its slow pace, its “perverse refusal to adopt superior approaches incorporating Unix and open standards and open-source software.” The pragmatist cares only about the most efficient outcome, which ESR equates to those prioritizing free market capitalism as the optimal economic outcome. I think it is important to emphasize efficiency, but that it is more important to have values-driven members of society who contribute to open source projects because they believe in its power and want to do something impactful, no matter how small.
      </p>

      <p>
        ESR proceeds to delve into the implications of peoples’ attitudes towards open source, understanding it to be a reputation game, gift-oriented, and somewhat akin to Lockean property customs. This “noosphere” — or territory of all possible ideas and creations — is one which begs to be settled by those freely wandering around in the open source community.
      </p>

      <p>
        What prevents people from contributing to open source is the notion of secrecy and intellectual property rights. It’s like how my dad will literally not give anyone the recipe to (1) his famous potato pie he makes every year for Christmas and (2) his stuffing he makes for Thanksgiving. It frustrates me to no end. It’s not like he has a restaurant — it is solely a matter of pride and exclusivity. ESR warns that “your secrets will still get exposed, you won't get free development help, and you won't have wasted your stupider competition's time on cloning” if you don’t open source. To me, those who refuse to open source their code are insecure, either in a justified or unjustified way. They are worried that their competitors will pounce on their ideas and one-up them, or that by revealing their code their product loses a lot of its power. I think it is valid sometimes to be worried about these things, when years of your life have been dedicated to solving this one problem or if your ability to make a living depends on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe the magic cauldron still has power. ESR kept referencing Linux as a success story, but that feels a bit outdated now (crazy, right?). Nevertheless, the true hackers, the ones who will have the most impact, are at their core aligned with the hacker ethic. To me, the only thing that could really get in the way of the free spread of information and open source repositories would be if one individual were to get a lot of power and restrict the flow. If one person accumulated a lot of wealth and power, grew their company to such an extent that they dominated several industries, and advanced well beyond open source projects, then open source could simply not compete. This is highly unlikely, however, as the probability of one genius being present in the massive open source pool is much greater than the probability of that same genius choosing to operate within the confines of a single corporation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The collective intelligence, creativity, and passion of the open source community will almost always outpace the innovation of even the most powerful individual, as long as the spirit of collaboration remains alive.
