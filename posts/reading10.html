      <h2>reading 10: once in a blue moon</h2>

      <p>Linux’ success is an awesome underdog story. When starting out in computer science, I thought Linux was just another company like Microsoft or Apple, just smaller and making a competing product. And to be honest, I kind of assumed it started out in Silicon Valley. I knew nothing about the backstory, about some random dude all the way over in Finland who created something that so many people take for granted.</p>

      <p>I do think it is proof of the power of hackers in the bazaar. But I feel like people like Linus come by once in a blue moon. It was the perfect combination of Linus being born at the right time in computer science history and his upbringing in Finland, which made him uninterested in the chase for money and fame that many Americans fall victim to. I loved his comment about Steve Jobs: “He was clueless, unable to imagine that there could be entire segments of the human race who weren’t the least bit concerned about increasing the Mac’s market share.”</p>

      <p>But I do not think Linus’ story was one of luck. Linux defied all odds because he was not too concerned about defying all the odds, and that grabbed people’s attention. I have not taken operating systems, so I cannot speak much to my own experience, but from reading <em>Just for Fun</em> and understanding Linus’ need to solve every problem, I am left with the impression that Linux does not have many holes in it. He loved it. Even in joining Transmeta, he wanted to be sure that Linux was secondary; he did not want to taint it and wanted it to remain his passion project.</p>

      <p>I am really glad to have taken this course and learned about a whole other side to computer science that I had no idea existed. I was very narrow-minded going in; I thought the goal (and, truthfully, only option) was to be a software engineer at a company like Google. I did not know about the systems guys or why Prof. Bui was so adamant about the Unix philosophy in Systems Programming; I did not know about Github, about the slew of open source projects the platform made possible; I did not know that there was this growing undercurrent of those promoting the Hacker Ethic, the MIT Hackers, the Berkeley ones, the ESRs and Richard Stallmans.</p>

      <p>People say majoring in computer science these days is like majoring in business. Business people rely on the establishment, on the existing intricate layers of corporate America to succeed (not to diss business — I’m going into it — but that’s the reality). But Linus showed us precisely how and why computer science is different from business, and, at times, its antithesis. Computer science is an artform, a science, a math, a hobby, and most importantly gives one the ability to make something entirely their own, which appeals to the sort of anti-establishment sentiment Linus spoke about, seeing it as “the Big, Evil Microsoft Corporation & Wicked, Greedy, Too-F-ing-Rich Bill Gates vs. the We’re-In-It-for-the-Love-and-Free-Software-for-Everybody and the self-Effacing (Seeming) Folk Hero Linus B. Torvalds thing.”</p>

      <p>When thinking about whether there will ever be another open-source success story as big as Linux, I am unsure. Linus himself says the very kids that shared the above sentiment went on to graduate and take jobs in corporations. Maybe it will just take another blue moon for there to be someone breaking the mold.</p>
