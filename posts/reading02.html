      <h2>reading 02: you can't have your cake and eat it too</h2>
      <p>The development and design of modern computers is owed entirely to the true hackers; to not spread the Hacker Ethic would be like handing a new generation the keys to cars without ever teaching them the rules of the road. Even if people disagree with some of its tenets, awareness of the ethos that informed the design of the devices they are using is crucial. Specifically, the hands-on imperative is important; people should be encouraged to explore and experiment with the technology. I agree that “The industrial approach is grim and doesn't work: the design motto is 'Design by Geniuses for Use by Idiots,' and the watchword for dealing with the untrained and unwashed public is KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF!” Indeed, the user should probe around inside the equipment. Further, it is the responsibility of the designers to balance making their technology accessible (e.g. BASIC programming language), though not covering up the entirety of the low-level processes that renders computers mystified black boxes. Moreover, I think everyone should have a degree of intention and mindfulness when approaching any form of new technology: How am I using this technology? Who is benefitting from me using it? Who is hurting because of it?</p>

      <p>I think the notion of compromising one’s ideals to have a larger impact on the world is not as black and white as it often seems. Granted, there are some who are in it strictly for financial success, and that case is pretty black and white. However, I think you can “sell out” while still retaining some of your principles; you can understand that in order to achieve a certain goal you must make sacrifices as that’s the way things are. It’s the classic “Don’t hate the player, hate the game” mentality. Wozniak’s decision to join Apple may have meant that he no longer was a pure hacker, but his resulting ability to spread his design to so many people must count for something. The hardware hackers were able to “make their passion into an industry,” and, at the end of the day, I think that would be my goal too.</p>

      <p>That being said, I have nothing but respect for those who stick to their principles through and through. They’re martyrs for their cause. Indeed, “Money was the means by which computer power was beginning to spread, and the hackers who ignored that fact were destined to work in (perhaps blissful) solipsism.” Further, the ones who ignored that fact likely will not see their hard work rewarded or get compensated for it at all, but they were never in it for fame or money anyway (after all, the $1.50/hour wage speaks for itself). As long as they retain their passion, their love of their craft, I fully believe their lives will be fulfilling. However, I think it can be easy for these true hackers to love their work so much and so obsessively that they want to see it succeed on exactly their terms and conditions, and to be extremely let down when they realize that such a feat is nearly impossible. You can’t have your cake and eat it too; if you believe that, you might be in for a world of hurt. Such was the case with Efrem: “‘I got so upset I started crying,’ he later said. ‘Because these people had stolen my profession. They made it impossible to be a computer person.’”</p>

      <p>I don’t mean to come off as a cynic whatsoever. I do not subscribe to the view that the world is the way it is, and that all we can do is sit back and let things happen to us. Rather, I think that the world is the way it is, that we will struggle and suffer, but that we have the freedom to make choices within it, that we are agents striving to make decisions we can only hope are the right ones. Jobs and Wozniak had a vision and made some sacrifices to see that vision realized, and hopefully they think they made the right call in the end - I think they did.</p>
